    "1. Takes in all jpgs in a directory, reads their exif data and then creates a new csv file with columns of Image Name / Time Taken / Date Taken\n",
    "2. Takes in the above csv file, calculates the total seconds elapsed from midnight for each image based off of the time value, then creates a new csv file with the columns Image Name / Time / Seconds Elapsed\n",
    "3. Takes in the corresponding flight file, and using the startWord = '[L-MIS]WP Mission: received idle vel cmd 2' or endWord = 'turn mode. end of trace. quit' to associate the flight file lines with real times. Using this real time, the total secodns past midnight is calculated. A new csv file is created, with first line having the start and end line outputted, and then the next line having column headers Seconds / Long / Lat / Altitude for every single line in the flight file. This allows for later matching with image capture times that were on misson and not on mission\n",
    "4. Creates two new csv files, InMissionData and NotInMissionData. Next it reads in both the stripped down flight file from script 3, and the csv file from script 2 and matches each jpg-elapsed second to a corresponding line in the stripped down flight file. Then images which have been identified as being on mission, from using row 1 of the stripped down flight file, have a row written to the InMissionData file which has columns Image Name/Long/Lat/Altitude, and images outwith the mission have a row written to the NotInMissionData file which has one column of Image Name\n",
    "5. Creates 2 new folders, InMissionData and OutMissionData, and within each folder creates a new folder names jpg and arw. Then by reading in the two csv files from Script 4, sorts the arw and jpg images accordingly to the new folders. Here it is assumed that each arw is directly associated with the same named jpg image\n"
